  Use this skill when the user wants to view table history, undo changes, rollback
  to a previous version, restore to a point in time, or check the audit log in
  Eddytor. Also use when the user mentions "version history", "rollback", "undo",
  "restore", "time travel", "audit log", "what changed", "revert", or "previous
  version" — even if they don't explicitly say "version control."

# Version Control & Time Travel

Every mutation creates a new Delta Lake version. You can inspect history, rollback to any version, or restore to any timestamp.

## Procedure: investigating and reverting a problem

1. `get_table_history` → review recent versions (operation, timestamp, user, metrics, comment)
2. Identify the last good version number or timestamp
3. Confirm with user before proceeding — rollback/restore are **destructive**
4. `rollback_table(table, version=N)` or `restore_table(table, timestamp="2024-06-15T14:30:00Z")`
5. `profile_table` + `validate_constraints` → confirm restored state

**Use** `rollback_table` when the user knows the exact version.
**Use** `restore_table` when the user knows the approximate time.

## Diff between versions

`diff_table_versions` compares two versions row-by-row — like `git diff` for table data.

* Requires at least one primary key column
* Returns `changeType` per row (`INSERT`, `DELETE`, `UPDATE`), `current`/`previous` values, and `changedColumns` for updates
* Handles schema evolution by comparing only columns present in both versions

Workflow: `get_table_history` → `diff_table_versions` → decide whether to `rollback_table`

## Audit trail

`get_audit_log` returns org-level entries. Filter by `table`, `action`, `from`/`to` timestamps.

Leave breadcrumbs with `merge_rows`:

```json
{ "comment": "Q1 price adjustment — approved by finance team", ... }
```

Comments appear in `get_table_history` and make finding rollback points much easier.

## Gotchas

* `rollback_table` and `restore_table` are **destructive** — all versions after the target are discarded. Always check history first.
* After `vacuum_table` with low retention, time-travel to old versions **fails** because underlying files are deleted. Default retention is 168 hours (7 days).
* `optimize_table` creates a version in history but doesn't change data — don't mistake it for a data change when reviewing history.
* `restore_table` timestamp must be ISO 8601 UTC (e.g., `"2024-06-15T14:30:00Z"`).

## Plan-validate-execute pattern for destructive operations

Before bulk deletes, schema changes, or domain changes:

1. `get_table_history` → note current version as your safety net
2. Execute the operation
3. `validate_constraints` + `profile_table` → confirm result
4. If something went wrong → `rollback_table` to the noted version

## Guidelines

* Always `get_table_history` before rollback/restore — never guess version numbers
* Confirm with user before executing — destructive operations have no undo
* Use `merge_rows` with `comment` for all significant changes
* After restore, validate: `profile_table` + `validate_constraints`
